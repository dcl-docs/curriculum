<small>(Builds on: [Vector functions](function-vector.md))</small>

Until now, you've been using vector functions inside `mutate()` to create new
columns. In *Vector functions*, you learned how to convert some scalar functions
into vector functions. Sometimes, however, you'll want to use a scalar function 
to create a new column, and you won't be able to convert that scalar function 
into a vector function. 

In this reading, you'll learn how to use row-wise operations to call a scalar
function multiple times with varying arguments. These operations can also be
used for row-wise aggregates and working with list-columns.
