Experience the full data science workflow by creating an RMarkdown file that
includes prose and code. __Knit__ the file to create output that intermingles
your text and the results of the code. This is an authentic workflow: the only
difference between this and what you'll use as a data scientist is that in
this class you'll always show your code so we can give you feedback on both
your results _and_ your process.
