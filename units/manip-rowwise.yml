desc: |
  Until now, you've been using vector functions inside `mutate()` to create new
  columns. In *Vector functions*, you learned how to convert some scalar functions
  into vector functions. Sometimes, however, you'll want to use a scalar function 
  to create a new column, and you won't be able to convert that scalar function 
  into a vector function. 
  
  In this reading, you'll learn how to use row-wise operations to call a scalar
  function multiple times with varying arguments. These operations can also be
  used for row-wise aggregates and working with list-columns.
